 _The world simplest yet powerful framework_

## Goal
Pandora developers seek to make this framework a very powerful one for penetrating testing, digital forensics etc,and to make it available for multiple platforms,since it  works perfectly on termux.Tell us if it works on other platforms too,and if it does not,tell us the errors so we fix them in upcoming updates.
